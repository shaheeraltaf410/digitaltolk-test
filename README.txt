What's Good:

Dependency Injection: The code uses dependency injection in the constructor to inject the BookingRepository, which is a good practice for managing dependencies and making the code more testable.

Controller Methods: Each method in the controller is relatively small and seems to have a clear responsibility. This adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Comments: Some of the methods have comments explaining their purpose, which is helpful for understanding the code.

he code utilizes Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions, which is a recommended approach for database operations in Laravel applications.

What's Okay:

Some function are extremely long. It's okay as long as it's well-documented and easy to understand. However, it might benefit from some refactoring to improve readability.

It's not clear from this code whether input validation is being performed. Input validation is essential for security, so it should be handled either in middleware or within these methods.

Some numeric values like '15' and '5' appear in the code without clear context. These should be replaced with named constants or configuration values to improve code readability and maintainability.

There are some cURL call using PHP cURL functions. It's better to use HTTP facede or GuzzleHttp for better performance in laravel.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What Could Be Improved:

The code hardcodes environment variables like env('ADMIN_ROLE_ID') and env('SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID'). It's better to define these values in a configuration file or use Laravel's configuration system to make them more maintainable.

The code lacks proper error handling. It should include try-catch blocks or appropriate validation to handle potential errors, especially in methods like resendSMSNotifications, where an exception might occur.

Some variables are named with underscores (e.g., $adminSenderEmail), while others use camelCase (e.g., $admincomment). Consistency in variable naming conventions would make the code easier to read.

Some methods are quite long and contains a lot of conditional logic. It would be beneficial to refactor this method into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.

There's some code duplication in terms of extracting data from the request ($data = $request->all();). Consider centralizing such common operations to reduce duplication.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In summary, the code demonstrates some good practices but also has room for improvement in terms of readability, maintainability, and error handling. Refactoring and following Laravel's conventions more closely would help in making the code more robust and easier to maintain. Additionally, adding input validation and error handling would be crucial for production-ready code.

NOTE:
In app/Repository/BookingRepository.php, I just refactor the few methods due to limited time. I just spent couple of hours on the task.
